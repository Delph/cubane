Navigation
==========

The CMS system provides a simple navigation system by which pages can be
organised into one or more navigation sections. For example, any given page may
appear in the header navigation, the footer navigation or both at the same time.

Navigation sections are declared in the following way as part of the
application settings:

.. code-block:: python

    CMS_NAVIGATION = (
        ('header', 'Header'),
        ('footer', 'Footer'),
    )

Navigation section are declared like choices where the first element declares
the internal name of the navigation section and the second element declares the
visual name of the navigation section that is presented to users in the backend
system.

In the example above, two navigation sections are declared: One called
``Header`` and another one called ``Footer``. Content editors can now assign
pages to one of those navigation sections (or both).

As a consequence, the following structures are available in the template when
rendering a page:

=================  =============================================================
Template Variable  Description
=================  =============================================================
nav                A structure that contains all navigation sections and
                   navigation items per section.
pages              A list of all pages that have a unique page identifier
                   assigned.
active_nav         The navigation item that is currently active.
=================  =============================================================

The following sections discuss those aspects in more details.

Navigation Sections
===================

The ``nav`` template variable contains all declared navigation sections by its
internal name. For example, if we had declared the following navigation
sections:

.. code-block:: python

    CMS_NAVIGATION = (
        ('header', 'Header'),
        ('footer', 'Footer'),
    )

Then the following template would render a list of links for all pages that are
assigned to the ``header`` navigation:

.. code-block:: html

    {% load cms_tags %}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <body>
            {% if nav.header %}
                <ul class="nav">
                    {% for item in nav.header %}
                        <li{% if item.active %} class="active"{% endif %}>
                            <a href="{{ item.url }}" title="{{ item.page_title }}">{{ item.title }}</a>
                        </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ul>
            {% endif %}
        </body>
    </html>

The same would work with the ``footer`` navigation respectively. The list
contains navigation items where each item is derived from the underlying page.

.. seealso::

    The navigation structure is constructed by a so called navigation builder,
    which can be altered, for example to control how navigation items are
    created. Please refer to section :ref:`topics/cms/navigation/builder` for more
    information.

The order in which items are listed is the order in which the underlying pages
are organised. The order for pages can be changed by content editors by using
the backend system.

Therefore there is a specific order to pages across all navigation sections. By
default, the order of items within each navigation section cannot be changed in
isolation.




.. _topics/cms/navigation/nav_items:

Navigation Items
================

A navigation item is representing most aspect of the underlying page including
its title and its URL but does not contain all information that reassembles the
underlying page such as page content.

Most noticeable, a navigation item has a ``page_title`` property which contains
the exact title of the underlying page. In a similar way the property
``nav_title`` is referring to a shorthand name of the page that is specifically
be used for the purpose of presenting the page within the concept of a
navigation system. However, this field is optional and might be ``None`` or
empty.

The property ``title`` simply returns the navigation title (``nav_title``) if a
value has been provided for it; otherwise the page title is used instead.

The property ``active`` is ``True`` if the current page is the page that the
navigation item is referring to.

    The construction of navigation items can be altered. Please refer to
    section :ref:`topics/cms/navigation/builder` for more information.

Navigation Item Children
========================

Pages can be organised within a hierarchy. Therefore a page can be a parent
page of another page.
