Overview

The cubane documentation is organised into the following sections. You may want
to get right into the code by following the tutorials or deep dive into
individual topics:

* :doc:`Introduction </tutorials/introduction>` gives you a quick introduction
  to cubane and what it is all about. Start here if want to find out what
  cubane is actually for.

* :doc:`Tutorials </tutorials/index>` take you by the hand through a series of
  step by step walkthroughts and tutorials. Start here if you're new to cubane.

* :doc:`Topic guides </topics/index>` discuss key topics and concepts at a
  high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

* Try the :doc:`FAQ <faq/index>`, where we give answers to commonly asked questions.

* Looking for specific information? Try the :ref:`genindex`, :ref:`modindex` or
  the `detailed table of contents <contents>`.


* `Reference guides </ref/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and
  other aspects of cubane. They describe how it works and how to
  use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* `How-to guides </howto/index>` are recipes. They guide you through the
  steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how cubane works.
