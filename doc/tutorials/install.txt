Quick install guide
===================

Cubane is easy to install for most Unix/Linux based platforms including Mac OS.
Windows is currently not supported.


Requirements
============

Cubane requires the following main components:

- Python 2.7
- Django 1.11

.. seealso::

    Please also compare the Python requirements for different Django_ versions.

    .. _django: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/faq/install/#faq-python-version-support


Install Python
==============

Cubane is written in the Python programming language; therefore we need to make
sure that we have python up and running first.

Get the latest version of Python 2.7+ at https://www.python.org/download/ or
with your operating system's package manager.

Cubane is currently supporting the latest version of python 2.7+. At the time
of writing, this is 2.7.12 for example.


Verifying Python
================

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like:

.. parsed-literal::

    Python 2.7.x
    [GCC 4.x on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>


Install Django
==============

Install the Django web framework. The easiest way to install Django is via
pip_, which is the recommended way to install python packages:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install Django==1.11

If you don't have ``pip`` installed, the easiest way is to use the `standalone
pip installer`_. However, your distribution might already provide pip out of
the box.

.. seealso::

    Please also review the `official documentation for installing Django`_.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
.. _standalone pip installer: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py
.. _official documentation for installing django: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/install/


Verifying Django
================

To verify that Django is available, type ``python`` from your shell. Then at
the Python prompt, try to import Django:

.. parsed-literal::

    >>> import django
    >>> print(django.get_version())
    1.11.13

.. note::

    Please make sure that the version of Django is the latest version of the
    ``1.11.x`` branch.


Installing Cubane
=================

After installing Django, you can easily install cubane via pip by typing:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install cubane


Verifying Cubane
================

To verify that Cubane is available, type ``python`` from your shell. At the
Python prompt, try to import Cubane:

    |version|
